                    <p>Welcome to my website! I'm Clyde D'Souza, a first-year undergraduate student at the University of Connecticut. I'm currently pursuing dual degrees in Molecular and Cell Biology and Applied Mathematics, with minors in Chemistry and English.</p>
                    <p>When I'm not in class or doing homework, I enjoy biking, leading future Huskies as a Husky Ambassador, or writing for our undergraduate newspaper, the Daily Campus. As a campus correspondent for the Life section, I regularly write articles about events and media throughout campus and the broader internet</p>
                    <p>At the moment I work part time as an undergraduate research assistant in the Biobehavioral Research Lab under Dr. Ruth Lucas, in the UConn School of Nursing. Additionally, I am a mathematics tutor at the Quantitative Learning Center, where I help teach Calculus I, II and III.</p>
                    <p>I'm also heavily involved in on and off-campus research. Throughout my first year at UConn, I assisted as an undergraduate research assistant in the Oral Drug Delivery Lab of Dr. Na Li, in the UConn School of Pharmacy, where I engaged in ongoing research on the diffusion dynamics of nanoparticles and amorphous solid dispersions. I have recently been accepted to the Health Research Program for the summer of 2024, where I am excited to work under Dr. Ephraim Trakhtenberg in the exciting field of neuronal regeneration.</p>
                    <p>I am not exactly sure where my trajectory will land me in the future, but I see my self at the intersection of medicine and bioinformatics research. To be continued!</p>
