                Today, just before 3:30 pm there was a solar eclipse. A large part of campus headed over to Horsebarn hill (myself and the hommies included) to check it out. In our part of Connecticut it was 90-something% occlusion, but there was only a slight dip in the brightness on the hill. It did get a little chillier for a few minutes. Oddly enough, the sun is so bright that even at such a high level of occlusion, you still couldn't look at the sun. We got a hold of some eclipse glasses and a solid crescent was noticeable. Occasionally we stared directly at the sun and let our retinas fry...who needs shades when the sun is mostly covered anyway? Everyone says that the next one is in a couple of decades but the last one was in 2017: my conclusion? Everyone's delulu!

                Took this photo of a friend's eclipse glasses. The reflection of people in the background gave this cool effect of the crescent being projected onto people.
